# CPU Raytracing
Toy CPU path tracer written entirely in Java.

## Running
Requires an installation of at least JDK-21.

Executable .jar files can be found in the target directory and can be run through the terminal by executing "java -jar target/demo_name.jar".

**IMPORTANT : By default renders are saved in the renders folder. For renders to be saved there you must be connected to the main project directory (not target) when running the .jar**
